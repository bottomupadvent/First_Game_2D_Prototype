# First_Game_2D_Prototype

- A simple 2D game prototype using **Arcade library** in **python**. 
- **Idea/Concept**: For individuals who have experienced getting on a running train that has just set in motion from the platform in India or in my case trains running on the Western Railways will find resonance. The idea is to navigate through the rush on railway platform to get on the moving train.
- This prototype is further manifested into a 3D Isometric view project using **Godot game engine**, source code for which can be found in [First_Game](https://github.com/bottomupadvent/First_Game) repository.
